          Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and
          statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The
          others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a
          lucky chance to become dearly loved.
        </p>
        <p class="about_text two">
          We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do
          not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and
          well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of
          various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the
          shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached to
          the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
